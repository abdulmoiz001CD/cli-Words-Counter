# cli-Words-Counter
This JavaScript program, intended to be executed with Node.js, uses the inquirer library to interact with the user via the command line. It prompts the user to enter a sentence, then splits the input into words and calculates the total number of words in the sentence. Finally, it displays the total count of words back to the user.
